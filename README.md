# Interactive Random Pixel generator

## Why this?

I always thought about the idea of random pixel generator and the oportunity
to use it as the digital time machine.

I found [Matt Kane](http://www.mattkane.com/) 's excelent site with the same ideas i had.
You can find there a FAQ, Program and Theory about this.

Read [PixelMonkey](http://pixelmonkeys.org/)


## What are we going to do?

First We are going to replace Matt's software with a one based on [Vue Framework](https://vuejs.org/)

Then We are going to add more feautures.


## Tooling

We are using [Vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)

This work is based on [vue-pixel](https://github.com/yhosun/vue-pixel) example.


## Run

```
  npm install
  npm run serve
```

## Todo

 - Better UI/UX
 - Change Palettes (colors)
 - Custom Image Size and Pixel Size
 - Custom funny Characters (frecuencies and Palettes)
 - Better Performance with WebAssembly
